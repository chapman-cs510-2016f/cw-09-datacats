    "    * Describe what the purpose of a Makefile is\n",
    "        *A makefile is made to update a target to the most recent version of the source. It contains rules for creating a target/targets and to update the target with the least amount of work possible. \n",
    "    *Describe how the code is organized here. Why is this a reasonable structure?\\\n",
    "        * The first thing that the code does is tell makefile that clean is not a actual file, so that it can later be called without an error. \n",
    "    *Describe what a header file is.\n",
    "        *It defines the functions type and any argument that it will take in and put it in a header file. This header file is called in the \".c\" file at the beginning and is a conveniant way to organize the code.\n",
    "    *Describe what a source file is.\n",
    "        *The source file is where you define your functions and specify exactly what the function is doing. \n",
    "    *Describe what an object file is.\n",
    "        *An object file is the compiled file of both the header and source code together. \n",
    "    *Describe what compiling is.\n",
    "        *Compiling is putting the source code and header together in one code into the object file. \n",
    "    *Describe what linking is.\n",
    "        *Takes object file and anything dependent on it and links them together and turns it into a executable code. \n"
